The Lipschitz constant should not be chosen as large as possible (since this will help with convergence and the numerical issues discussed above), but if chosen to small, it may cut of the feasible region and lead to a sub-optimal solution.\nYou need to ensure that the cost-to-go function is concave with respect to the objective state before the update.\nIf the update function is linear, this is always the case.

During the winter, [they want] to decide how much land to devote to each crop.The farmer knows that at least 200 tons (T) of wheat and 240 T of corn are needed for cattle feed. These amounts can be raised on the farm or bought from a wholesaler. Any production in excess of the feeding requirement would be sold.Over the last decade, mean selling prices have been $170 and $150 per ton of wheat and corn, respectively. The purchase prices are 40% more than this due to the wholesaler’s margin and transportation costs.Another profitable crop is sugar beet, which [they expect] to sell at $36/T; however, the European Commission imposes a quota on sugar beet production. Any amount in excess of the quota can be sold only at $10/T. The farmer’s quota for next year is 6000 T.\"Based on past experience, the farmer knows that the mean yield on [their] land is roughly 2.5 T, 3 T, and 20 T per acre for wheat, corn, and sugar beets, respectively.[To introduce uncertainty,] assume some correlation among the yields of the different crops. A very simplified representation of this would be to assume that years are good, fair, or bad for all crops, resulting in above average, average, or below average yields for all crops. To fix these ideas, above and below average indicate a yield 20% above or below the mean yield.","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/the_farmers_problem/#Problem-data","page":"The farmer's problem","title":"Problem data","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"examples/the_farmers_problem/","page":"The farmer's problem","title":"The farmer's problem","text":"The area of the farm.","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/the_farmers_problem/","page":"The farmer's problem","title":"The farmer's problem","text":"MAX_AREA = 500.0","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/the_farmers_problem/","page":"The farmer's problem","title":"The farmer's problem","text":"500.0","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/the_farmers_problem/","page":"The farmer's problem","title":"The farmer's problem","text":"There are three crops:","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/the_farmers_problem/","page":"The farmer's problem","title":"The farmer's problem","text":"CROPS = [:wheat, :corn, :sugar_beet]","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/the_farmers_problem/","page":"The farmer's problem","title":"The farmer's problem","text":"3-element Vector{Symbol}:\n :wheat\n :corn\n :sugar_beet","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/the_farmers_problem/","page":"The farmer's problem","title":"The farmer's problem","text":"Each of the crops has a different planting cost ($/acre).","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/the_farmers_problem/","page":"The farmer's problem","title":"The farmer's problem","text":"PLANTING_COST = Dict(:wheat => 150.0, :corn => 230.0, :sugar_beet => 260.0)","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/the_farmers_problem/","page":"The farmer's problem","title":"The farmer's problem","text":"Dict{Symbol, Float64} with 3 entries:\n  :wheat => 150.0\n  :sugar_beet => 260.0\n  :corn => 230.0","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/the_farmers_problem/","page":"The farmer's problem","title":"The farmer's problem","text":"The farmer requires a minimum quantity of wheat and corn, but not of sugar beet (tonnes).","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/the_farmers_problem/","page":"The farmer's problem","title":"The farmer's problem","text":"MIN_QUANTITIES = Dict(:wheat => 200.0, :corn => 240.0, :sugar_beet => 0.0)","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/the_farmers_problem/","page":"The farmer's problem","title":"The farmer's problem","text":"Dict{Symbol, Float64} with 3 entries:\n  :wheat => 200.0\n  :sugar_beet => 0.0\n  :corn => 240.0","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/the_farmers_problem/","page":"The farmer's problem","title":"The farmer's problem","text":"In Europe, there is a quota system for producing crops.

We assume that our aim is to minimize  future cost p'z. If we maximize reward, we would have p ∈ argmin{p'z}.\na is the uniform distribution\nr is a user specified radius - the larger the radius, the more conservative the policy.\n\nNotes\n\nThe largest radius that will work with S scenarios is sqrt((S-1)/S).\n\nIf the uncorrected standard deviation of the objecive realizations is less than minimum_std, then the risk-measure will default to Expectation().\n\nThis code was contributed by Lea Kapelevich.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"guides/add_a_risk_measure/","page":"Add a risk measure","title":"Add a risk measure","text":"SDDP.adjust_probability(\n    SDDP.ModifiedChiSquared(0.5),\n    risk_adjusted_probability,\n    [0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25],\n    noise_supports,\n    cost_realizations,\n    is_minimization\n)\n\nround.(risk_adjusted_probability, digits = 4)\n\n# output\n\n4-element Vector{Float64}:\n 0.3333\n 0.0447\n 0.622\n 0.0","category":"page"},{"location":"guides/add_a_risk_measure/#Wasserstein","page":"Add a risk measure","title":"Wasserstein","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"guides/add_a_risk_measure/","page":"Add a risk measure","title":"Add a risk measure","text":"SDDP.Wasserstein","category":"page"},{"location":"guides/add_a_risk_measure/#SDDP.Wasserstein","page":"Add a risk measure","title":"SDDP.Wasserstein","text":"Wasserstein(norm::Function, solver_factory; alpha::Float64)\n\nA distributionally-robust risk measure based on the Wasserstein distance.\n\nAs alpha increases, the measure becomes more risk-averse.
