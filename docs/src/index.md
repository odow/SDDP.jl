# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for [`SDDP.jl`](https://github.com/odow/SDDP.jl), a
package for solving large multistage convex stochastic programming problems
using *stochastic dual dynamic programming*.

SDDP.jl is built on [JuMP](https://jump.dev), so it supports a number of
open-source and commercial solvers, making it a powerful and flexible tool for
stochastic optimization.

The implementation of the stochastic dual dynamic programming algorithm in
SDDP.jl is state of the art, and it includes support for a number of advanced
features not commonly found in other implementations. This includes support for:

 * infinite horizon problems
 * convex risk measures
 * mixed-integer state and control variables
 * partially observable stochastic processes.

## Installation

Install `SDDP.jl` as follows:

```julia
julia> import Pkg

julia> Pkg.add("SDDP")
```

## Resources for getting started

There are a few ways to get started with SDDP.jl:

 * Become familiar with JuMP by reading the [JuMP documentation](http://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/stable/)
 * Read the introductory tutorial [An introduction to SDDP.jl](@ref)
 * Browse some of the examples, such as [Example: deterministic to stochastic](@ref)

If you need help, please [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/odow/SDDP.jl/issues/new).

## How the documentation is structured

Having a high-level overview of how this documentation is structured will help
you know where to look for certain things.

* **Tutorials** contains step-by-step explanations of how to use SDDP.jl. Once
  you've got `SDDP.jl` installed, start by reading [An introduction to SDDP.jl](@ref).

* **Guides** contains "how-to" snippets that demonstrate specific topics within
  SDDP.jl. A good one to get started on is [Debug a model](@ref).

* **Explanation** contains step-by-step explanations of the theory and
  algorithms that underpin SDDP.jl. If you want a basic understanding of the
  algorithm behind SDDP.jl, start with [Introductory theory](@ref).

* **Examples** contain worked examples of various problems solved using SDDP.jl.
  A good one to get started on is the [Hydro-thermal scheduling](@ref) problem.
  In particular, it shows how to solve an infinite horizon problem.

* The **API Reference** contains a complete list of the functions you can use in
  SDDP.jl. Look here if you want to know how to use a particular function.
