# Release notes

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## v1.6.3 (September 8, 2023)

### Fixed

 - Fixed default stopping rule with `iteration_limit` or `time_limit` set (#662)

### Other

 - Various documentation improvements (#651) (#657) (#659) (#660)

## v1.6.2 (August 24, 2023)

### Fixed

 - `MSPFormat` now detect and exploit stagewise independent lattices (#653)
 - Fixed `set_optimizer` for models read from file (#654)

### Other

 - Fixed typo in `pglib_opf.jl` (#647)
 - Fixed documentation build and added color (#652)

## v1.6.1 (July 20, 2023)

### Fixed

 - Fixed bugs in `MSPFormat` reader (#638) (#639)

### Other

 - Clarified `OutOfSampleMonteCarlo` docstring (#643)

## v1.6.0 (July 3, 2023)

### Added

 - Added [`RegularizedForwardPass`](@ref) (#624)
 - Added [`FirstStageStoppingRule`](@ref) (#634)

### Other

 - Removed an unbound type parameter (#632)
 - Fixed typo in docstring (#633)
 - Added [Here-and-now and hazard-decision](@ref) tutorial (#635)

## v1.5.1 (June 30, 2023)

This release contains a number of minor code changes, but it has a large impact
on the content that is printed to screen. In particular, we now log
periodically, instead of each iteration, and a "good" stopping rule is used as
the default if none are specified. Try using `SDDP.train(model)` to see the
difference.

### Other

 - Fixed various typos in the documentation (#617)
 - Fixed printing test after changes in JuMP (#618)
 - Set [`SimulationStoppingRule`](@ref) as the default stopping rule (#619)
 - Changed the default logging frequency. Pass `log_every_seconds = 0.0` to
   [`train`](@ref) to revert to the old behavior. (#620)
 - Added example usage with Distributions.jl (@slwu89) (#622)
 - Removed the numerical issue `@warn` (#627)
 - Improved the quality of docstrings (#630)

## v1.5.0 (May 14, 2023)

### Added

 - Added the ability to use a different model for the forward pass. This is a
   novel feature that lets you train better policies when the model is
   non-convex or does not have a well-defined dual. See the [Alternative forward models](@ref)
   tutorial in which we train convex and non-convex formulations of the optimal
   power flow problem. (#611)

### Other

 - Updated missing `changelog` entries (#608)
 - Removed global variables (#610)
 - Converted the `Options` struct to keyword arguments. This struct was a
   private implementation detail, but the change is breaking if you developed an
   extension to SDDP that touched these internals. (#612)
 - Fixed some typos (#613)

## v1.4.0 (May 8, 2023)

### Added

 - Added [`SDDP.SimulationStoppingRule`](@ref) (#598)
 - Added `sampling_scheme` argument to [`SDDP.write_to_file`](@ref) (#607)

### Fixed

 - Fixed parsing of some `MSPFormat` files (#602) (#604)
 - Fixed printing in header (#605)

## v1.3.0 (May 3, 2023)

### Added

 - Added experimental support for `SDDP.MSPFormat.read_from_file` (#593)

### Other

 - Updated to StochOptFormat v0.3 (#600)

## v1.2.1 (May 1, 2023)

### Fixed

 - Fixed `log_every_seconds` (#597)

## v1.2.0 (May 1, 2023)

### Added

 - Added [`SDDP.SimulatorSamplingScheme`](@ref) (#594)
 - Added `log_every_seconds` argument to [`SDDP.train`](@ref) (#595)

### Other

 - Updated to StochOptFormat v0.2 (#592)

## v1.1.4 (April 10, 2023)

### Fixed

 - Logs are now flushed every iteration (#584)

### Other

### Other

 - Fixed typo in [Example: deterministic to stochastic](@ref) tutorial (#578)
 - Fixed typo in documentation of [`SDDP.simulate`](@ref) (#577)

## v1.1.2 (March 18, 2023)

### Other

 - Added [Example: deterministic to stochastic](@ref) tutorial (#572)

## v1.1.1 (March 16, 2023)

### Other

 - Fixed email in `Project.toml`
 - Added notebook to documentation tutorials (#571)

## v1.1.0 (January 12, 2023)

### Added

 - Added the `node_name_parser` argument to [`SDDP.write_cuts_to_file`](@ref)
   and added the option to skip nodes in [`SDDP.read_cuts_from_file`](@ref)
   (#565)

## v1.0.0 (January 3, 2023)

Although we're bumping MAJOR version, this is a non-breaking release. Going
forward:

 - New features will bump the MINOR version
 - Bug fixes, maintenance, and documentation updates will bump the PATCH
   version
 - We will support only the Long Term Support (currently v1.6.7) and the latest
   patch (currently v1.8.4) releases of Julia. Updates to the LTS version will
   bump the MINOR version
 - Updates to the compat bounds of package dependencies will bump the PATCH
   version.

We do not intend any breaking changes to the public API, which would require a
new MAJOR release. The public API is everything defined in the documentation.
Anything not in the documentation is considered private and may change in any
PATCH release.

### Added

   support for things like [`SDDP.ContinuousConicDuality`](@ref) and
   [`SDDP.LagrangianDuality`](@ref). It was breaking because we removed the
   `integrality_handler` argument to `PolicyGraph`. (#449) (#453)

## v0.1.0 (October 17, 2019)

A complete rewrite of SDDP.jl based on the policy graph framework. This was
essentially a new package. It has minimal code in common with the previous
implementation.

Development started on September 28, 2018 in [Kokako.jl](https://github.com/odow/Kokako.jl),
and the code was merged into `SDDP.jl` on March 14, 2019.

The pull request [SDDP.jl#180](https://github.com/odow/SDDP.jl/pull/180) lists
the 29 issues that the rewrite closed.

## v0.0.1 (April 18, 2018)

Initial release. Development had been underway since January 22, 2016 in the
[StochDualDynamicProgram.jl](https://github.com/odow/StochDualDynamicProgram.jl)
repository. The last development commit there was April 5, 2017. Work then
continued in this repository for a year before the first tagged release.
