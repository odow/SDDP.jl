# Tutorial Eight: odds and ends

In our previous tutorials, we have discussed the formulation, solution, and
visualization of a multistage stochastic optimization problem. By now you should
have all the tools necessary to solve your own problems using SDDP.jl. However,
there are a few odds and ends that we need to address.

## The `@state` macro

In [Tutorial One: first steps](@ref), we introduced a single state variable.
However, much more complex syntax is supported. This syntax hijacks JuMP's
`@variable` macro syntax, so it will be familiar to users of JuMP, but may look
unusual at first glance.
```julia
RESERVOIRS = [ :upper, :middle, :lower ]
V0 = Dict(
    :upper  = 10.0,
    :middle =  5.0,
    :lower  =  2.5
)
@state(m, volume[reservoir=RESERVOIRS], initial_volume == V0[reservoir])
```
This will create JuMP variables that can be accessed as `volume[:upper]` and
`initial_volume[:lower]`. There is also [`@states`](@ref), an analogue to JuMP's
`@variables` macro. It can be used as follows:
```julia
@states(sp, begin
    x >= 0,   x0==1
    y[i=1:2], y0==i
end)
```

## `if` statements in more detail

In [Tutorial Four: Markovian policy graphs](@ref), we used an `if` statement to
control the call to `setnoiseprobability!` depending on the Markov state.
This can be used much more generally. For example:
```julia
m = SDDPModel(
    #...arguments omitted ...
        ) do sp, t, i
    @state(m, x>=0, x0==0)
    if t == 1
        @stageobjective(m, x)
    else
        if i == 1
            @variable(m, u >= 1)
            @constraint(m, x0 + u == x)
        else
            @rhsnoise(m, w=[1,2], x0 + w == x)
        end
        @stageobjective(m, x0 + x)
    end
end
```

You could, of course, do the following as well:
```julia
function first_stage(sp::JuMP.Model, x0, x)
    @stageobjective(m, x)
end
function second_stage(sp::JuMP.Model, x0, x)
    if i == 1
        @variable(m, u >= 1)
        @constraint(m, x0 + u == x)
    else
        @rhsnoise(m, w=[1,2], x0 + w == x)
    end
    @stageobjective(m, x0 + x)
end
m = SDDPModel(
    #...arguments omitted ...
        ) do sp, t, i
    @state(m, x>=0, x0==0)
    if t == 1
        first_stage(m, x0, x)
    else
        second_stage(m, x0, x)
    end
end
```

## Stage-dependent risk measures

In [Tutorial Five: risk](@ref), we discussed adding risk measures to our model.
We used the same risk measure for every stage. However, often you may want to
have time-varying risk measures. This can be accomplished very easily: instead
of passing a risk measure to the `risk_measure` keyword argument, we pass a
function that takes two inputs: `t::Int`, the index of the stage; and `i::Int`,
the index of the Markov state. For example:
```julia
function build_my_risk_measure(t::Int, i::Int)
    if t == 1
        return Expectation()
    elseif i == 1
        return AVaR(0.5)
    else
        return 0.5 * Expectation() + 0.5 * WorstCase()
    end
end

m = SDDPModel(
    # ... arguments omitted ...
    risk_measure = build_my_risk_measure
                                ) do sp, t, i
    # ... formulation omitted ...
end
```

## Reading and writing cuts to file

It's possible to save the cuts that are discovered during a solve to a file so
that they can be read back in or used for other analysis. This can be done using
the `cut_output_file` to [`solve`](@ref):
```julia
m = build_model()
SDDP.solve(m
    max_iterations  = 10,
    cut_output_file = "cuts.csv"
)
```
`cuts.csv` is a csv file with `N+3` columns, where `N` is the number of state
variables in the model. The columns are: (1) the index of the stage; (2) the
index of the Markov state; (3) the intercept; and (4+), the coefficients of the
cuts for each of the state variables.

This cut file can be read back into a model using [`loadcuts!`](@ref):
```julia
m2 = build_model()
loadcuts!(m2, "cuts.csv")
```
