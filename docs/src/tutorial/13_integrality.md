# Advanced III: integrality

The fundamental reason why SDDP works is convexity. In the classical algorithm,
this ruled out the use of integer variables. However, various extensions to the
algorithm have been proposed, and these can be run by `SDDP.jl` using the
`integrality_handler` keyword argument to [`SDDP.PolicyGraph`](@ref).

## Continuous relaxation

If your model includes binary or integer variables (e.g.,
[`air_conditioning.jl`](https://github.com/odow/SDDP.jl/blob/master/examples/air_conditioning.jl)),
passing `integrality_handler = SDDP.ContinuousRelaxation()` will make
`SDDP.jl` contruct a (sub-optimal) policy using the continuous relaxation of
the problem. But, when you simulate this policy, `SDDP.jl` will solve the
original mixed-integer problem.

## SDDiP

If you pass `integrality_handler = SDDP.SDDiP()`, SDDP.jl will use the
stochastic dual dynamic integer programming method of Zou, Ahmed, and Sun. See
[`SDDP.SDDiP`](@ref) for more.
