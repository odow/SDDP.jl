    is_cyclic(G::PolicyGraph{T}) where {T}

Return `true` or `false` if the graph `G` contains a cycle.

We implement Tarjan's strongly connected components algorithm to detect
cycles in a directed graph in O(|V| + |E|) time. See this Wiki for details
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarjan%27s_strongly_connected_components_algorithm
The notation here follows the pseudocode in the Wikipedia article, rather
than the typical JuMP style guide.

Since we're only checking for cyclic graphs, we can stop as soon as on is
found. A cyclic graph has a stongly connected component with at least two
components, or it has a node with connects to itself. That means we don't
need to store the set of all strongly connected components.
