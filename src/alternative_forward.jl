    AlternativeForwardPass(
        forward_model::SDDP.PolicyGraph{T};
        forward_pass::AbstractForwardPass = DefaultForwardPass(),
    )

A forward pass that simulates using `forward_model`, which may be different to
the model used in the backwards pass.

When using this forward pass, you should almost always pass
[`SDDP.AlternativePostIterationCallback`](@ref) to the `post_iteration_callback`
argument of [`SDDP.train`](@ref).

This forward pass is most useful when the `forward_model` is non-convex and we
use a convex approximation of the model in the backward pass.

For example, in optimal power flow models, we can use an AC-OPF formulation as
the `forward_model` and a DC-OPF formulation as the backward model.
