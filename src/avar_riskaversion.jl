# Description

A risk measure that is a convex combination of Expectation and Average Value @ Risk
(also called Conditional Value @ Risk).

    λ * E[x] + (1 - λ) * AV@R(1-β)[x]

# Keyword Arguments

 * `lambda`
Convex weight on the expectation (`(1-lambda)` weight is put on the AV@R component.
Inreasing values of `lambda` are less risk averse (more weight on expecattion)

 * `beta`
 The quantile at which to calculate the Average Value @ Risk. Increasing values
 of `beta` are less risk averse. If `beta=0`, then the AV@R component is the
 worst case risk measure.

# Returns
    `m::NestedAVaR<:AbstractRiskMeasure`
