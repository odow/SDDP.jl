    AverageCut(; lower_bound = -Inf, upper_bound = Inf, deletion_minimum = 1)

The AverageCut Bellman function. Provide a `lower_bound` if minimizing, or an
`upper_bound` if maximizing.

This Bellman function also implements Level-One cut selection. This requires a
solver that supports constraint deletion. If the solver doesn't support
constraint deletion (e.g., Ipopt), JuMP must be used in Automatic mode instead
of direct mode. In automatic mode, constraint deletion incurs a high cost
because a new model is copied to the solver with every change. Thus, it is
possible to cache constraint deletions until `deletion_minimum` are ready to
improve performance. Cut selection can be "turned off" by setting
`deletion_minimum` to a very large positive integer.
