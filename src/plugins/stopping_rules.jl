Perform an in-sample Monte Carlo simulation of the policy with
`num_replications` replications every `iteration_period`s. Terminate if the
deterministic bound (lower if minimizing) calls into the confidence interval for
the mean of the simulated cost. If `verbose = true`, print the confidence
interval.

Note that this tests assumes that the simulated values are normally distributed.
In infinite horizon models, this is almost never the case. The distribution is
usually closer to exponential or log-normal.

"""

Teriminate the algorithm once the deterministic bound (lower if minimizing,
upper if maximizing) fails to improve by more than `tolerance` in absolute terms
for more than `num_previous_iterations` consecutve iterations, provided it has
improved relative to the bound after the first iteration.

Checking for an improvement relative to the first iteration avoids early
termination in a situation where the bound fails to improve for the first `N`
iterations. This frequently happens in models with a large number of stages,
where it takes time for the cuts to propogate backward enough to modify the
bound of the root node.
