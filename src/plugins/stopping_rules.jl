    Statistical(; num_replications, iteration_period = 1, z_score = 1.96,

Perform an in-sample Monte Carlo simulation of the policy with
`num_replications` replications every `iteration_period`s. Terminate if the
deterministic bound (lower if minimizing) calls into the confidence interval for
the mean of the simulated cost. If `verbose = true`, print the confidence
interval.

Note that this tests assumes that the simulated values are normally distributed.
In infinite horizon models, this is almost never the case. The distribution is
usually closer to exponential or log-normal.
