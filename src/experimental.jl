An example. I can't test on Travis as we can't install Gurobi.

    using SDDP, JuMP, Gurobi, Base.Test
    m = SDDPModel(
            sense           = :Min,
            stages          = 2,
            objective_bound = 0.0,
            solver          = GurobiSolver(OutputFlag=0) ) do sp, t
        @state(sp, x>=0, x0==1.0)
        r_x = addconstraintnoise!(sp, x0, [1,2])
        @constraint(sp, x == r_x)
        @stageobjective(sp, x)

"""
    addconstraintnoise!(sp::JuMP.Model, x::JuMP.Variable, realizations::Vector{T}) where T

Add a stagewise-independent coefficient term into the model.

Important:
  - Requires a solver that has implemented the `MathProgBase.changecoeffs!`
    method.
  - Cannot be used if `JuMP.solvehook` is set (e.g., by SDDiP.jl).

If multiple terms have random coefficents, then the length of realizations must
be the same in every case. This can also be used with stagewise-independent
right-hand side terms (via `@rhsnoise`), again with equal numbers of
realizations.

### Example
If `w âˆˆ [1,2,3]` with equal probability, and we want to add the constraint:
    @constraint(sp, 2x + w*x <= 1)
Then
    wx = addconstraintnoise!(sp, x, [1,2,3])
    @constraint(m, 2x + wx <= 1)

Note: This is a bit of a hack. Given a term `w*x` in the model, for example, in
a constraint such as `2x + w*x <= 1`, we introduce a dummy variable and a dummy
constraint so that: `dummyconstraint: dummy_variable == w * x`. This allows us
to deterministically work around the fact that JuMP cannot modify the
coefficient matrix.
