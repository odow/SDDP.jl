This problem is a version of the Ambulance dispatch problem. A hospital is
located at 0 on the number line that stretches from 0 to 100. Ambulance bases
are located at points 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100. When not responding to a call,
Ambulances must be located at a base, or the hospital. In this example there are
three ambulances.

Example location:

    H       B       B       B       B       B
    0 ---- 20 ---- 40 ---- 60 ---- 80 ---- 100

Each stage, a call comes in from somewhere on the number line. The agent must
decide which ambulance to dispatch. They pay the cost of twice the driving
distance. If an ambulance is not dispatched in a stage, the ambulance can be
relocated to a different base in preparation for future calls. This incurrs a
cost of the driving distance.

Properly formulated, this problem requires binary state variables. However,
SDDP.jl cannot solve such problems. Therefore we solve the LP relaxation.

Checkout github.com/lkapelevich/SDDiP.jl for a multi-stage stochastic
programming solver with binary state variables.
