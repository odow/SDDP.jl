Example: The Perishable Widget Producer

A company produces perishable, divisible widgets (i.e. a continuous product,
rather than discrete units) for sale on a spot market each month. The quantity
of widgets they produce is uncertain and comes from some finite distribution.

The company can store the widgets, but, over time, the value of the widgets
decreases. Eventually the widgets perish and are worthless.

The spot price is determined by an auction system, and so varies from month to
month, but demonstrates serial correlation. In each auction, there is sufficient
demand that the widget producer finds a buyer for all their widgets, regardless
of the quantity they supply. Furthermore, the spot price is independent of the
widget producer (they are a small player in the market).

The spot price is highly volatile, and is the result of a process that is out of
the control of the company. To counteract their price risk, the company engages
in a forward contracting programme.

The forward contracting programme is a deal for physical widgets at a future
date in time. The company can engage in contracts for sales up to six months in
the future.

The futures price is the current spot price, plus some forward contango (the
buyers gain certainty that they will receive the widgets in the future).

In general, the widget company should forward contract (since they reduce their
price risk), however they also have production risk. Therefore, it may be the
case that they forward contract a fixed amount, but find that they do not
produce enough widgets to meet the fixed demand. They are then forced to buy
additional widgets on the spot market.

The goal of the widget company is to choose the extent to which they forward
contract in order to maximise (risk-adjusted) revenues, whilst managing their
production risk.

To run this example, there are two options.

1. From the command line:

    cmd> julia -p N perishablewidgets.jl

    This will start Julia with N processors. It N > 2, SDDP.jl will choose to
    solve using the Asyncronous solver. Upon completion, Julia will exit so make
    sure you write to file (or save) any results.

2. Interactively:
    cmd> julia -p N
    julia> include("perishablewidgets.jl")

    Upon completion, the model and results will be available for inspection.

# These are a few of my favourite things...
using SDDP, JuMP, Gurobi

#==
    For repeatability we should set the random number seed. However, if we
    choose the same seed on all processors, then we end up doing identical
    things! myid() returns an integer of the pocessor id, so this way we get
    a unique random seed for all processors.
==#
@everywhere srand(myid() * 10)

#==
    Here is where we start the construction of our SDDP Model

m = SDDPModel(

    solver            = GurobiSolver(OutputFlag=0),
    # solver            = ClpSolver(),
    #==
        We use Nested Average Value @ Risk for our risk measure:

            (1 - λ) * E[X] + λ * AV@R(β)[X].

        Increasing values of lambda are more risk averse. beta is the fraction
        of the tail we are worried about. Therefore, decreasing values of beta
        are more risk averse.

                                The spot price is a mean reverting, log-normal,
                                AR(1) model:

                                log(y(t)) = (1 - α) log(y(t-1)) + α * log(μ) + e,

                                where α is the rate at which the process reverts
                                to the mean, and μ is the mean that the process
                                reverts to.

                                Note: dynamics can't depend on other things and
                                you must supply a function

                                If you don't know what the markov state is, just
                                add the input, but don't reference it. It won't
                                matter.

        one cut at each subproblem.

        When we wish to test for convergence we switch to the simulation phase.

        phase. The simulation keyword controls the simulation phase of the

            evidence of convergence keep going with the cutting iterations
            sice more simulations will only refine the estimate.

            If we reach max simulations and there is still evidence of
            convergence, then we can terminate with termination=true.

        Frequency with which the problems are rebuilt. No good rule. Aggressive
        cut selection reduces the size of the subproblems (good) but has

    Let's save the model to disk so we can come back to it later. Note this is
    pretty fragile and is not guaranteed to break between Julia serialiser
    versions.
==#
SDDP.savemodel!("contracting.sddpm", m)

# load a saved model
m2 = SDDP.loadmodel("contracting.sddpm")

# simulate with the saved model
results2 = simulate(m2,
    200,               # number of monte carlo realisations
    [   :contracts, :contracts0, :storage, :sell_on_spot,
        :contract_sells, :buy_on_spot, :production         ]
)
