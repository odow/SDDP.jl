"""
A farm planning problem. There are four stages. The first stage is a
deterministic  planning stage. The next three are wait-and-see operational
stages. The uncertainty in the three operational stages is a Markov chain for
weather. There are three Markov states: dry, normal, and wet.

Inspired by
  R. McCardle, Farm management optimization. Masters thesis, University
  of Louisville, Louisville, Kentucky, United States of America (2009)

All data, including short variable names, is taken from that thesis.
