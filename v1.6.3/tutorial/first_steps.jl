# # An introduction to SDDP.jl

# SDDP.jl is a solver for multistage stochastic optimization problems. By
# **multistage**, we mean problems in which an agent makes a sequence of
# decisions over time. By **stochastic**, we mean that the agent is making
# decisions in the presence of uncertainty that is gradually revealed over the
# multiple stages.

# !!! tip
#     Multistage stochastic programming has a lot in common with fields like
#     stochastic optimal control, approximate dynamic programming, Markov
#     decision processes, and reinforcement learning. If it helps, you can think
#     of SDDP as Q-learning in which we approximate the value function using
#     linear programming duality.

# This tutorial is in two parts. First, it is an introduction to the background
# notation and theory we need, and second, it solves a simple multistage
# stochastic programming problem.

# ## What is a node?

# A common feature of multistage stochastic optimization problems is that they
# model an agent controlling a system over time. To simplify things initially,
# we're going to start by describing what happens at an instant in time at which
# the agent makes a decision. Only after this will we extend our problem to
# multiple stages and the notion of time.

# A **node** is a place at which the agent makes a decision.

# !!! tip
#     For readers with a stochastic programming background, "node" is synonymous
#     with "stage" in this section. However, for reasons that will become clear
#     shortly, there can be more than one "node" per instant in time, which is
#     why we prefer the term "node" over "stage."

# ### States, controls, and random variables

# The system that we are modeling can be described by three types of variables.

# 1. **State** variables track a property of the system over time.

#    Each node has an associated _incoming_ state variable (the value of the
#    state at the start of the node), and an _outgoing_ state variable (the
#    value of the state at the end of the node).
#
#    Examples of state variables include the volume of water in a reservoir, the
#    number of units of inventory in a warehouse, or the spatial position of a
#    moving vehicle.
#
#    Because state variables track the system over time, each node must have the
#    same set of state variables.
#
#    We denote state variables by the letter $x$ for the incoming state variable
#    and $x^\prime$ for the outgoing state variable.
#
# 2. **Control** variables are actions taken (implicitly or explicitly) by the
#    agent within a node which modify the state variables.
#
#    Examples of control variables include releases of water from the reservoir,
#    sales or purchasing decisions, and acceleration or braking of the vehicle.
#
#    Control variables are local to a node $i$, and they can differ between
#    nodes. For example, some control variables may be available within certain
#    nodes.
#
#    We denote control variables by the letter $u$.
#
# 3. **Random** variables are finite, discrete, exogenous random variables that
#    the agent observes at the start of a node, before the control variables are
#    decided.
#
#    Examples of random variables include rainfall inflow into a reservoir,
#    probabilistic perishing of inventory, and steering errors in a vehicle.
#
#    Random variables are local to a node $i$, and they can differ between
#    nodes. For example, some nodes may have random variables, and some nodes
#    may not.
#
#    We denote random variables by the Greek letter $\omega$ and the sample
#    space from which they are drawn by $\Omega_i$. The probability of sampling
#    $\omega$ is denoted $p_{\omega}$ for simplicity.
#
#    Importantly, the random variable associated with node $i$ is independent of
#    the random variables in all other nodes.

# ### Dynamics

# In a node $i$, the three variables are related by a **transition function**,
# which maps the incoming state, the controls, and the random variables to the
# outgoing state as follows: $x^\prime = T_i(x, u, \omega)$.

# As a result of entering a node $i$ with the incoming state $x$, observing
# random variable $\omega$, and choosing control $u$, the agent incurs a cost
# $C_i(x, u, \omega)$. (If the agent is a maximizer, this can be a profit, or a
# negative cost.) We call $C_i$ the **stage objective**.

# To choose their control variables in node $i$, the agent uses a **decision**
# **rule** $u = \pi_i(x, \omega)$, which is a function that maps the incoming
# state variable and observation of the random variable to a control $u$. This
# control must satisfy some feasibility requirements $u \in U_i(x, \omega)$.

# Here is a schematic which we can use to visualize a single node:

# ![Hazard-decision node](../assets/hazard_decision.png)

# ## Policy graphs

# Now that we have a node, we need to connect multiple nodes together to form a
# multistage stochastic program. We call the graph created by connecting nodes
# together a **policy graph**.

# The simplest type of policy graph is a **linear policy graph**. Here's a
# linear policy graph with three nodes:

# ![Linear policy graph](../assets/stochastic_linear_policy_graph.png)

# Here we have dropped the notations inside each node and replaced them by a
# label (1, 2, and 3) to represent nodes `i=1`, `i=2`, and `i=3`.

# In addition to nodes 1, 2, and 3, there is also a root node (the circle), and
# three arcs. Each arc has an origin node and a destination node, like `1 => 2`,
# and a corresponding probability of transitioning from the origin to the
# destination. Unless specified, we assume that the arc probabilities are
# uniform over the number of outgoing arcs. Thus, in this picture the arc
# probabilities are all 1.0.

# State variables flow long the arcs of the graph. Thus, the outgoing state
# variable $x^\prime$ from node 1 becomes the incoming state variable $x$ to
# node 2, and so on.

# We denote the set of nodes by $\mathcal{N}$, the root node by $R$, and the
# probability of transitioning from node $i$ to node $j$ by $p_{ij}$. (If no arc
# exists, then $p_{ij} = 0$.) We define the set of successors of node $i$ as
# $i^+ = \{j \in \mathcal{N} | p_{ij} > 0\}$.

# Each node in the graph corresponds to a place at which the agent makes a
# decision, and we call moments in time at which the agent makes a decision
# **stages**. By convention, we try to draw policy graphs from left-to-right,
# with the stages as columns. There can be more than one node in a stage! Here's
# an example of a structure we call **Markovian policy graphs**:

# ![Markovian policy graph](../assets/enso_markovian.png)

# Here each column represents a moment in time, the squiggly lines represent
# stochastic rainfall, and the rows represent the world in two discrete states:
# El Niño and La Niña. In the El Niño states, the distribution of the rainfall
# random variable is different to the distribution of the rainfall random
# variable in the La Niña states, and there is some switching probability
# between the two states that can be modelled by a Markov chain.

# Moreover, policy graphs can have cycles! This allows them to model infinite
# horizon problems. Here's another example, taken from the paper
# [Dowson (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1002/net.21932):

# ![POWDer policy graph](../assets/powder_policy_graph.png)

# The columns represent time, and the rows represent different states of the
# world. In this case, the rows represent different prices that milk can be sold
# for at the end of each year. The squiggly lines denote a multivariate random
# variable that models the weekly amount of rainfall that occurs.

# !!! note
#     The sum of probabilities on the outgoing arcs of node $i$ can be less than
#     1, i.e., $\sum\limits_{j\in i^+} p_{ij} \le 1$. What does this mean?
#     One interpretation is that the probability is a [discount factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discounting).
#     Another interpretation is that there is an implicit "zero" node that we
#     have not modeled, with $p_{i0} = 1 - \sum\limits_{j\in i^+} p_{ij}$.
#     This zero node has $C_0(x, u, \omega) = 0$, and $0^+ = \varnothing$.

# ## More notation

# Recall that each node $i$ has a **decision rule** $u = \pi_i(x, \omega)$,
# which is a function that maps the incoming state variable and observation of
# the random variable to a control $u$.

# The set of decision rules, with one element for each node in the policy graph,
# is called a **policy**.

# The goal of the agent is to find a policy that minimizes the expected cost of
# starting at the root node with some initial condition $x_R$, and proceeding
# from node to node along the probabilistic arcs until they reach a node with no
# outgoing arcs (or it reaches an implicit "zero" node).

# ```math
# \min_{\pi} \mathbb{E}_{i \in R^+, \omega \in \Omega_i}[V_i^\pi(x_R, \omega)],
# ```
# where
# ```math
# V_i^\pi(x, \omega) = C_i(x, u, \omega) + \mathbb{E}_{j \in i^+, \varphi \in \Omega_j}[V_j(x^\prime, \varphi)],
# ```
# where $u = \pi_i(x, \omega) \in U_i(x, \omega)$, and
# $x^\prime = T_i(x, u, \omega)$.

# The expectations are a bit complicated, but they are equivalent to:
# ```math
# \mathbb{E}_{j \in i^+, \varphi \in \Omega_j}[V_j(x^\prime, \varphi)] = \sum\limits_{j \in i^+} p_{ij} \sum\limits_{\varphi \in \Omega_j} p_{\varphi}V_j(x^\prime, \varphi).
# ```

# An optimal policy is the set of decision rules that the agent can use to make
# decisions and achieve the smallest expected cost.

# ## Assumptions

# !!! warning
#     This section is important!

# The space of problems you can model with this framework is very large. Too
# large, in fact, for us to form tractable solution algorithms for! Stochastic
# dual dynamic programming requires the following assumptions in order to work:

# **Assumption 1: finite nodes**
#
# There is a finite number of nodes in $\mathcal{N}$.
#
# **Assumption 2: finite random variables**
#
# The sample space $\Omega_i$ is finite and discrete for each node
# $i\in\mathcal{N}$.
#
# **Assumption 3: convex problems**
#
# Given fixed $\omega$, $C_i(x, u, \omega)$ is a convex function,
# $T_i(x, u, \omega)$ is linear, and  $U_i(x, u, \omega)$ is a non-empty,
# bounded convex set with respect to $x$ and $u$.
#
# **Assumption 4: no infinite loops**
#
# For all loops in the policy graph, the product of the arc transition
# probabilities around the loop is strictly less than 1.
#
# **Assumption 5: relatively complete recourse**
#
# This is a technical but important assumption. See [Relatively complete recourse](@ref)
# for more details.

# !!! note
#     SDDP.jl relaxes assumption (3) to allow for integer state and control
#     variables, but we won't go into the details here. Assumption (4)
#     essentially means that we obtain a discounted-cost solution for
#     infinite-horizon problems, instead of an average-cost solution; see
#     [Dowson (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1002/net.21932) for details.

# ## Dynamic programming and subproblems

# Now that we have formulated our problem, we need some ways of computing
# optimal decision rules. One way is to just use a heuristic like "choose a
# control randomly from the set of feasible controls." However, such a policy
# is unlikely to be optimal.

# A better way of obtaining an optimal policy is to use [Bellman's principle of
# optimality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman_equation#Bellman's_principle_of_optimality),
# a.k.a Dynamic Programming, and define a recursive **subproblem** as follows:
# ```math
# \begin{aligned}
# V_i(x, \omega) = \min\limits_{\bar{x}, x^\prime, u} \;\; & C_i(\bar{x}, u, \omega) + \mathbb{E}_{j \in i^+, \varphi \in \Omega_j}[V_j(x^\prime, \varphi)]\\
# & x^\prime = T_i(\bar{x}, u, \omega) \\
# & u \in U_i(\bar{x}, \omega) \\
# & \bar{x} = x.
# \end{aligned}
# ```
# Our decision rule, $\pi_i(x, \omega)$, solves this optimization problem and
# returns a $u^*$ corresponding to an optimal solution.
#
# !!! note
#     We add $\bar{x}$ as a decision variable, along with the fishing constraint
#     $\bar{x} = x$ for two reasons: it makes it obvious that formulating a
#     problem with $x \times u$ results in a bilinear program instead of a
#     linear program (see Assumption 3), and it simplifies the implementation of
#     the SDDP algorithm.

# These subproblems are very difficult to solve exactly, because they involve
# recursive optimization problems with lots of nested expectations.

# Therefore, instead of solving them exactly, SDDP.jl works by iteratively
# approximating the expectation term of each subproblem, which is also called
# the cost-to-go term. For now, you don't need to understand the details, other
# than that there is a nasty cost-to-go term that we deal with
# behind-the-scenes.

# The subproblem view of a multistage stochastic program is also important,
# because it provides a convenient way of communicating the different parts of
# the broader problem, and it is how we will communicate the problem to SDDP.jl.
# All we need to do is drop the cost-to-go term and fishing constraint, and
# define a new subproblem `SP` as:
# ```math
# \begin{aligned}
# \texttt{SP}_i(x, \omega) : \min\limits_{\bar{x}, x^\prime, u} \;\; & C_i(\bar{x}, u, \omega) \\
# & x^\prime = T_i(\bar{x}, u, \omega) \\
# & u \in U_i(\bar{x}, \omega).
# \end{aligned}
# ```
# !!! note
#     When we talk about formulating a **subproblem** with SDDP.jl, this is the
#     formulation we mean.

# We've retained the transition function and uncertainty set because they help
# to motivate the different components of the subproblem. However, in general,
# the subproblem can be more general. A better (less restrictive) representation
# might be:
# ```math
# \begin{aligned}
# \texttt{SP}_i(x, \omega) : \min\limits_{\bar{x}, x^\prime, u} \;\; & C_i(\bar{x}, x^\prime, u, \omega) \\
# & (\bar{x}, x^\prime, u) \in \mathcal{X}_i(\omega).
# \end{aligned}
# ```
# Note that the outgoing state variable can appear in the objective, and we can
# add constraints involving the incoming and outgoing state variables. It
# should be obvious how to map between the two representations.

# ## Example: hydro-thermal scheduling

# Hydrothermal scheduling is the most common application of stochastic dual
# dynamic programming. To illustrate some of the basic functionality of
# `SDDP.jl`, we implement a very simple model of the hydrothermal scheduling
# problem.

# ### Problem statement

# We consider the problem of scheduling electrical generation over three weeks
# in order to meet a known demand of 150 MWh in each week.
#
# There are two generators: a thermal generator, and a hydro generator. In each
# week, the agent needs to decide how much energy to generate from thermal, and
# how much energy to generate from hydro.
#
# The thermal generator has a short-run marginal cost of \$50/MWh in the first
# stage, \$100/MWh in the second stage, and \$150/MWh in the third stage.
#
# The hydro generator has a short-run marginal cost of \$0/MWh.
#
# The hydro generator draws water from a reservoir which has a maximum capacity
# of 200 MWh. (Although water is usually measured in m³, we measure it in the
# energy-equivalent MWh to simplify things. In practice, there is a conversion
# function between m³ flowing throw the turbine and MWh.) At the start of the
# first time period, the reservoir is full.
#
# In addition to the ability to generate electricity by passing water through
# the hydroelectric turbine, the hydro generator can also spill water down a
# spillway (bypassing the turbine) in order to prevent the water from
# over-topping the dam. We assume that there is no cost of spillage.

# In addition to water leaving the reservoir, water that flows into the reservoir
# through rainfall or rivers are referred to as inflows. These inflows are
# uncertain, and are the cause of the main trade-off in hydro-thermal
# scheduling: the desire to use water now to generate cheap electricity, against
# the risk that future inflows will be low, leading to blackouts or expensive
# thermal generation.

# For our simple model, we assume that the inflows can be modelled by a discrete
# distribution with the three outcomes given in the following table:
#
# | ω    |   0 |  50 | 100 |
# | ---- | --- | --- | --- |
# | P(ω) | 1/3 | 1/3 | 1/3 |

# The value of the noise (the random variable) is observed by the agent at the
# start of each stage. This makes the problem a _wait-and-see_ or
# _hazard-decision_ formulation.

# The goal of the agent is to minimize the expected cost of generation over the
# three weeks.

# ### Formulating the problem

# Before going further, we need to load SDDP.jl:

using SDDP

# #### Graph structure

# First, we need to identify the structure of the policy graph. From the problem
# statement, we want to model the problem over three weeks in weekly stages.
# Therefore, the policy graph is a linear graph with three stages:

graph = SDDP.LinearGraph(3)

# #### Building the subproblem

# Next, we need to construct the associated subproblem for each node in `graph`.
# To do so, we need to provide SDDP.jl a function which takes two arguments. The
# first is `subproblem::Model`, which is an empty JuMP model. The second is
# `node`, which is the name of each node in the policy graph. If the graph is
# linear, SDDP defaults to naming the nodes using the integers in `1:T`. Here's
# an example that we are going to flesh out over the next few paragraphs:

function subproblem_builder(subproblem::Model, node::Int)
    ## ... stuff to go here ...
    return subproblem
end

# !!! warning
#     If you use a different type of graph, `node` may be a type different to
#     `Int`. For example, in [`SDDP.MarkovianGraph`](@ref), `node` is a
#     `Tuple{Int,Int}`.

# #### State variables

# The first part of the subproblem we need to identify are the state variables.
# Since we only have one reservoir, there is only one state variable, `volume`,
# the volume of water in the reservoir [MWh].
#
# The volume had bounds of `[0, 200]`, and the reservoir was full at the start
# of time, so $x_R = 200$.

# We add state variables to our `subproblem` using JuMP's `@variable` macro.
# However, in addition to the usual syntax, we also pass `SDDP.State`, and we
# need to provide the initial value ($x_R$) using the `initial_value` keyword.

function subproblem_builder(subproblem::Model, node::Int)
    ## State variables
    @variable(subproblem, 0 <= volume <= 200, SDDP.State, initial_value = 200)
    return subproblem
end

# The syntax for adding a state variable is a little obtuse, because `volume` is
# not single JuMP variable. Instead, `volume` is a struct with two fields, `.in`
# and `.out`, corresponding to the incoming and outgoing state variables
# respectively.

# !!! note
#     We don't need to add the fishing constraint $\bar{x} = x$; SDDP.jl does
#     this automatically.

# #### Control variables

# The next part of the subproblem we need to identify are the control variables.
# The control variables for our problem are:
#  - `thermal_generation`: the quantity of energy generated from thermal
#    [MWh/week]
#  - `hydro_generation`: the quantity of energy generated from hydro [MWh/week]
#  - `hydro_spill`: the volume of water spilled from the reservoir in each week
#    [MWh/week]
# Each of these variables is non-negative.

# We add control variables to our `subproblem` as normal JuMP variables, using
# `@variable` or `@variables`:

function subproblem_builder(subproblem::Model, node::Int)
    ## State variables
    @variable(subproblem, 0 <= volume <= 200, SDDP.State, initial_value = 200)
    ## Control variables
    @variables(subproblem, begin
        thermal_generation >= 0
        hydro_generation >= 0
        hydro_spill >= 0
    end)
    return subproblem
end

# !!! tip
#     Modeling is an art, and a tricky part of that art is figuring out which
#     variables are state variables, and which are control variables. A good
#     rule is: if you need a value of a control variable in some future node to
#     make a decision, it is a state variable instead.

# #### Random variables

# The next step is to identify any random variables. In our example, we had
#  - `inflow`: the quantity of water that flows into the reservoir each week
#    [MWh/week]

# To add an uncertain variable to the model, we create a new JuMP variable
# `inflow`, and then call the function [`SDDP.parameterize`](@ref). The
# [`SDDP.parameterize`](@ref) function takes three arguments: the subproblem, a
# vector of realizations, and a corresponding vector of probabilities.

function subproblem_builder(subproblem::Model, node::Int)
    ## State variables
    @variable(subproblem, 0 <= volume <= 200, SDDP.State, initial_value = 200)
    ## Control variables
    @variables(subproblem, begin
        thermal_generation >= 0
        hydro_generation >= 0
        hydro_spill >= 0
    end)
    ## Random variables
    @variable(subproblem, inflow)
    Ω = [0.0, 50.0, 100.0]
    P = [1 / 3, 1 / 3, 1 / 3]
    SDDP.parameterize(subproblem, Ω, P) do ω
        return JuMP.fix(inflow, ω)
    end
    return subproblem
end

# Note how we use the JuMP function
# [`JuMP.fix`](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/stable/reference/variables/#JuMP.fix)
# to set the value of the `inflow` variable to `ω`.

# !!! warning
#     [`SDDP.parameterize`](@ref) can only be called once in each subproblem
#     definition! If your random variable is multi-variate, read
#     [Add multi-dimensional noise terms](@ref).

# #### Transition function and constraints

# Now that we've identified our variables, we can define the transition function
# and the constraints.

# For our problem, the state variable is the volume of water in the reservoir.
# The volume of water decreases in response to water being used for hydro
# generation and spillage. So the transition function is:
# `volume.out = volume.in - hydro_generation - hydro_spill + inflow`. (Note how
# we use `volume.in` and `volume.out` to refer to the incoming and outgoing
# state variables.)

# There is also a constraint that the total generation must sum to 150 MWh.

# Both the transition function and any additional constraint are added using
# JuMP's `@constraint` and `@constraints` macro.

function subproblem_builder(subproblem::Model, node::Int)
    ## State variables
    @variable(subproblem, 0 <= volume <= 200, SDDP.State, initial_value = 200)

            demand_constraint, hydro_generation + thermal_generation == 150
        end
    )
    return subproblem
end

# #### Objective function

# Finally, we need to add an objective function using `@stageobjective`. The
# objective of the agent is to minimize the cost of thermal generation. This is
# complicated by a fuel cost that depends on the `node`.
#
# One possibility is to use an `if` statement on `node` to define the correct
# objective:

            demand_constraint, hydro_generation + thermal_generation == 150
        end
    )
    ## Stage-objective
    if node == 1
        @stageobjective(subproblem, 50 * thermal_generation)
    elseif node == 2
        @stageobjective(subproblem, 100 * thermal_generation)
    else
        @assert node == 3
        @stageobjective(subproblem, 150 * thermal_generation)
    end
    return subproblem
end

# ### Constructing the model

# Now that we've written our subproblem, we need to construct the full model.
# For that, we're going to need a linear solver. Let's choose HiGHS:

using HiGHS

# !!! warning
#     In larger problems, you should use a more robust commercial LP solver like
#     Gurobi. Read [Words of warning](@ref) for more details.

# Then, we can create a full model using [`SDDP.PolicyGraph`](@ref), passing our
# `subproblem_builder` function as the first argument, and our `graph` as the
# second:

model = SDDP.PolicyGraph(
    subproblem_builder,
    graph;
    sense = :Min,
    lower_bound = 0.0,
    optimizer = HiGHS.Optimizer,
)

# * `sense`: the optimization sense. Must be `:Min` or `:Max`.
# * `lower_bound`: you _must_ supply a valid bound on the objective. For our
#   problem, we know that we cannot incur a negative cost so \$0 is a valid
#   lower bound.
# * `optimizer`: This is borrowed directly from JuMP's `Model` constructor:
#   `Model(HiGHS.Optimizer)`

# Because linear policy graphs are the most commonly used structure, we can use
# [`SDDP.LinearPolicyGraph`](@ref) instead of passing `SDDP.LinearGraph(3)` to
# [`SDDP.PolicyGraph`](@ref).

model = SDDP.LinearPolicyGraph(
    subproblem_builder;
    stages = 3,
    sense = :Min,
    lower_bound = 0.0,
    optimizer = HiGHS.Optimizer,
)

# There is also the option is to use Julia's `do` syntax to avoid needing to
# define a `subproblem_builder` function separately:

model = SDDP.LinearPolicyGraph(
    stages = 3,
    sense = :Min,
    lower_bound = 0.0,
    optimizer = HiGHS.Optimizer,
) do subproblem, node
    ## State variables
    @variable(subproblem, 0 <= volume <= 200, SDDP.State, initial_value = 200)
    ## Control variables
    @variables(subproblem, begin
        thermal_generation >= 0
        hydro_generation >= 0
        hydro_spill >= 0
    end)
    ## Random variables
    @variable(subproblem, inflow)
    Ω = [0.0, 50.0, 100.0]
    P = [1 / 3, 1 / 3, 1 / 3]
    SDDP.parameterize(subproblem, Ω, P) do ω
        return JuMP.fix(inflow, ω)
    end
    ## Transition function and constraints
    @constraints(
        subproblem,
        begin
            volume.out == volume.in - hydro_generation - hydro_spill + inflow
            demand_constraint, hydro_generation + thermal_generation == 150
        end
    )
    ## Stage-objective
    if node == 1
        @stageobjective(subproblem, 50 * thermal_generation)
    elseif node == 2
        @stageobjective(subproblem, 100 * thermal_generation)
    else
        @assert node == 3
        @stageobjective(subproblem, 150 * thermal_generation)
    end
end

# !!! info
#     Julia's `do` syntax is just a different way of passing an anonymous
#     function `inner` to some function `outer` which takes `inner` as the first
#     argument. For example, given:
#     ```julia
#     outer(inner::Function, x, y) = inner(x, y)
#     ```
#     then
#     ```julia
#     outer(1, 2) do x, y
#         return x^2 + y^2
#     end
#     ```
#     is equivalent to:
#     ```julia
#     outer((x, y) -> x^2 + y^2, 1, 2)
#     ```
#     For our purpose, `inner` is `subproblem_builder`, and `outer` is
#     [`SDDP.PolicyGraph`](@ref).

# ## Training a policy

# Now we have a model, which is a description of the policy graph, we need to
# train a policy. Models can be trained using the [`SDDP.train`](@ref) function.
# It accepts a number of keyword arguments. `iteration_limit` terminates the
# training after the provided number of iterations.

SDDP.train(model; iteration_limit = 10)

# There's a lot going on in this printout! Let's break it down.

# The first section, "problem," gives some problem statistics. In this example
# there are 3 nodes, 1 state variable, and 27 scenarios ($3^3$). We haven't
# solved this problem before so there are no existing cuts.

# The "options" section lists some options we are using to solve the problem.
# For more information on the numerical stability report, read the
# [Numerical stability report](@ref) section.

# The "subproblem structure" section also needs explaining. This looks at all of
# the nodes in the policy graph and reports the minimum and maximum number of
# variables and each constraint type in the corresponding subproblem. In this
# case each subproblem has 7 variables and various numbers of different
# constraint types. Note that the exact numbers may not correspond to the
# formulation as you wrote it, because SDDP.jl adds some extra variables for the
# cost-to-go function.

# Then comes the iteration log, which is the main part of the printout. It has
# the following columns:
#  - `iteration`: the SDDP iteration
#  - `simulation`: the cost of the single forward pass simulation for that
#    iteration. This value is stochastic and is not guaranteed to improve over
#    time. However, it's useful to check that the units are reasonable, and that
#    it is not deterministic if you intended for the problem to be stochastic,
#    etc.
#  - `bound`: this is a lower bound (upper if maximizing) for the value of the
#    optimal policy. This should be monotonically improving (increasing if
#    minimizing, decreasing if maximizing).
#  - `time (s)`: the total number of seconds spent solving so far
#  - `solves`: the total number of subproblem solves to date. This can be very
#    large!
#  - `pid`: the ID of the processor used to solve that iteration. This
#    should be 1 unless you are using parallel computation.

# In addition, if the first character of a line is `†`, then SDDP.jl experienced
# numerical issues during the solve, but successfully recovered.

# The printout finishes with some summary statistics:
#
#  - `status`: why did the solver stop?
#  - `total time (s)`, `best bound`, and `total solves` are the values from the
#    last iteration of the solve.
#  - `simulation ci`: a confidence interval that estimates the quality of the
#    policy from the `Simulation` column.
#  - `numeric issues`: the number of iterations that experienced numerical
#    issues.

# !!! warning
#     The `simulation ci` result can be misleading if you run a small number of
#     iterations, or if the initial simulations are very bad. On a more
#     technical note, it is an _in-sample simulation_, which may not reflect the
#     true performance of the policy. See [Obtaining bounds](@ref) for more
#     details.

# ## Obtaining the decision rule

# After training a policy, we can create a decision rule using
# [`SDDP.DecisionRule`](@ref):

rule = SDDP.DecisionRule(model; node = 1)

# Then, to evaluate the decision rule, we use [`SDDP.evaluate`](@ref):

solution = SDDP.evaluate(
    rule;
    incoming_state = Dict(:volume => 150.0),
    noise = 50.0,
    controls_to_record = [:hydro_generation, :thermal_generation],
)

# ## Simulating the policy

# Once you have a trained policy, you can also simulate it using
# [`SDDP.simulate`](@ref). The return value from `simulate` is a vector with one
# element for each replication. Each element is itself a vector, with one
# element for each stage. Each element, corresponding to a particular stage in a
# particular replication, is a dictionary that records information from the
# simulation.

simulations = SDDP.simulate(
    ## The trained model to simulate.
    model,
    ## The number of replications.
    100,
    ## A list of names to record the values of.
    [:volume, :thermal_generation, :hydro_generation, :hydro_spill],
)

replication = 1
stage = 2
simulations[replication][stage]

# Ignore many of the entries for now;  they will be relevant later.

#  One element of interest is `:volume`.

outgoing_volume = map(simulations[1]) do node
    return node[:volume].out
end

#  Another is `:thermal_generation`.

thermal_generation = map(simulations[1]) do node
    return node[:thermal_generation]
end

# ## Obtaining bounds

# Because the optimal policy is stochastic, one common approach to quantify the
# quality of the policy is to construct a confidence interval for the expected
# cost by summing the stage objectives along each simulation.

objectives = map(simulations) do simulation
    return sum(stage[:stage_objective] for stage in simulation)
end

μ, ci = SDDP.confidence_interval(objectives)
println("Confidence interval: ", μ, " ± ", ci)

# This confidence interval is an estimate for an upper bound of the policy's
# quality. We can calculate the lower bound using [`SDDP.calculate_bound`](@ref).

println("Lower bound: ", SDDP.calculate_bound(model))

# !!! tip
#     The upper- and lower-bounds are reversed if maximizing, i.e., [`SDDP.calculate_bound`](@ref).
#     returns an upper bound.

# ## Custom recorders

# In addition to simulating the primal values of variables, we can also pass
# custom recorder functions. Each of these functions takes one argument, the
# JuMP subproblem corresponding to each node. This function gets called after we
# have solved each node as we traverse the policy graph in the simulation.

# For example, the dual of the demand constraint (which we named
# `demand_constraint`) corresponds to the price we should charge for
# electricity, since it represents the cost of each additional unit of demand.
# To calculate this, we can go:

simulations = SDDP.simulate(
    model,
    1,  ## Perform a single simulation
    custom_recorders = Dict{Symbol,Function}(
        :price => (sp::JuMP.Model) -> JuMP.dual(sp[:demand_constraint]),
    ),
)

prices = map(simulations[1]) do node
    return node[:price]
end

# ## Extracting the marginal water values

# Finally, we can use [`SDDP.ValueFunction`](@ref) and [`SDDP.evaluate`](@ref)
# to obtain and evaluate the value function at different points in the
# state-space.

# !!! note
#     By "value function" we mean $\mathbb{E}_{j \in i^+, \varphi \in \Omega_j}[V_j(x^\prime, \varphi)]$,
#     note the function $V_i(x, \omega)$.

# First, we construct a value function from the first subproblem:

V = SDDP.ValueFunction(model; node = 1)

# Then we can evaluate `V` at a point:

cost, price = SDDP.evaluate(V, Dict("volume" => 10))

# This returns the cost-to-go (`cost`), and the gradient of the cost-to-go
# function with respect to each state variable. Note that since we are
# minimizing, the price has a negative sign: each additional unit of water leads
# to a decrease in the expected long-run cost.
